My name is Max De George and I am a Software Developer working within Microsoft's Power Platform at eLogic. I graduated from the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) with a Bachelor's in Game Design & Development, but have been focused in the Web Development technologies throughout all of college and beyond.

I have always been interested in developing tools and working on projects to make my life easier, but no matter the task, I've always been plagued with the same thought: How do I even do that? 

My goal for this blog is to dive head first into the different projects I plan to work on and hope that both you and I learn what this world calls Web Development as you watch me flounder, flail, and crawl my way to the finish line. It may not be pretty the first time around, but that's the point of learning: fail until you succeed.

Feel free to comment on tips, tricks, or criticism (preferrably constructive) that will not only help me become a better developer, but also help others. No one is an island, and I sure could use the help.
